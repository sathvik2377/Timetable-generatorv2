# Smart India Hackathon 2025 - Judges Q&A
## NEP 2020 Compliant Timetable Generator

---

## **Q1: What makes your solution unique compared to existing timetable generators?**

**A:** Our solution introduces several groundbreaking innovations:

1. **Points-Based Scheduling Algorithm**: Unlike traditional constraint-based systems, we use a novel points allocation system where:
   - Teachers start with points = (Working hours/day) Ã— 100
   - Classes receive 100 points per hour taught
   - Teachers cannot work when points reach 0 (prevents overallocation)
   - Ensures perfect resource balance and prevents teacher burnout

2. **NEP 2020 Full Compliance**: First timetable generator specifically designed for India's New Education Policy 2025:
   - Flexible credit system (1-6 credits per subject)
   - Multidisciplinary learning support
   - Skill-based education integration
   - Research block allocation

3. **OR-Tools CP-SAT Integration**: Advanced constraint programming with Google's world-class optimization engine
4. **Real-time Feasibility Validation**: Instant feedback on resource allocation before generation
5. **Branch-Specific Generation**: Each department gets unique, optimized timetables

---

## **Q2: How does your points-based algorithm work technically?**

**A:** The algorithm operates in 5 phases:

### Phase 1: Points Initialization
```
Teacher Points = Max Working Hours/Day Ã— 100
Example: 6 hours/day = 600 points
```

### Phase 2: Requirement Calculation
```
Class Points Needed = Max Class Hours/Week Ã— 100
Example: 25 hours/week = 2500 points needed
```

### Phase 3: Feasibility Check
```
Total Available = Teachers Ã— Teacher Points Ã— Working Days
Total Required = Classes Ã— Class Points Needed
Must be equal for valid generation
```

### Phase 4: OR-Tools Optimization
- Creates boolean variables for each possible session
- Applies points constraints alongside traditional ones
- Optimizes for room utilization, teacher load balance, schedule quality

### Phase 5: Solution Extraction
- Converts solver output to readable timetable
- Validates points allocation
- Generates multiple variants with different optimization strategies
